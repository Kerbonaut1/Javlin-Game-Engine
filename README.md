# Javelin Game Engine

## The concept
Linux and Unreal

Linux is a great open source OS but linux has something called "distros" a distribution of the OS more specialised to its niche, I want to apply this to the game engine world.

Unreal is very very powerfull engine but not very good at games that arent first person shooters

The Goal: 

Achive something (hopefully) powerfull for designers like unreal and extendable like linux

## Making a game (and also sort of the engine too)
To make a game you add modules to the engine, effectivly creating a distro of the engine for your game meaning you can have a engine that is perfect for your game and not have to worry about the engine being bloated with features you dont need
